    "# Project Description\n",
    "This idea is of an Amusement Park named Planet Fun with hundreds of rides, activities, concessions, and employees. The idea of an Amusement Park is one that has been around for years, but what makes this park special is that it is Space Themed! We chose this project because it was a business we all thought was interesting and interactive. We believe that database management is an integral part of this business and we wanted to test it through this project. The rides will range from twisty rollercoasters to light playground swings. There will be a cool mix of science presented at each ride so that the kids will be able to learn something new while having so much fun. The food is available inside the park at different concession, but will be a separate cost for customers not included in the ticket cost. All the food is priced differently.We started by specifying the five entities in the amuesment park which are: End users (customers), employees, rides, concessions, food/drinks. As a group, we decided that these factors are the most integral parts of our amusement park business and that we need to focus on how to sort data in order to see where we have to optimize our business. Our goal is to figure out which types of rides and concessions are the most popular. We will use data tables in our ER diagram to help us categorize the rides and concessions, and  to see in real time which rides and concessions are most popular. This will let us know which kinds of rides and concessions we should include when we expand our park. We got to our final ER diagram by going off the five entities we listed above. We started by identifying relationships between entities and we connected them and added how they interacted in the middle with words like \"buy\". Finally, we added cardinality with numbers we thought were apppropriate.  "

    "# ER Diagram Discussion\n",
    "The purpose of this entity relationship diagram is to track information on rides, customers, concessions, sales, employees, and food at an amusement park. Customers can ride rides and make purchases at concessions. To identify customers, the primary key CustomerID has the attributes name, email, age, gender, and pass type. Pass type includes season and single day passes. For each transaction, we give a saleID as a primary key, and track of the customer, food purchased, the employee that was involved, and the concession table. Not every transaction must be for food or at a concession table or has an employee involved. This table changes and needs to be updated when additional transactions occur. Concession tables are given a concessionID for their primary key and have a name, location, food type, and the employee’s ID. There will be one employee at every concession table. The EmployeeID is the primary key for the employee table which keeps track of the first and last name of the employee and their experience level. The EmployeeID is also a foreign key for the ride table in addition to the sales and concessions table. The Ride Table uses rideID as a primary key for each ride at the park and keeps track of its name, location, intensity, average wait time, and the employee. Lastly, our Food Table gives each food a foodID and gives information on its price and size. It has concessionID as a foreign key, telling us which concession the food is located at."

    "# Database Creation Discription\n",
    "The database was created first by making sure that any previous tables with the same name are dropped. Then the frame work of the data base is created, and each of the tables are created. Then, each table is filled with a random selection of their respective entities. The goal was to fill the tables to match the design of the ER diagram. It was also important to make sure that the tables with foreign keys, such as the sales table, had a value that matched a primary key in a separate table. Lastly, we wanted to make sure that no primary key was repeated in any table, so that all entities were clearly defined and unique."

    "#  Scenario \n",
    "For the scenario, we are going to follow a group of 6 friends going to the park for the day. At the gate, they would get park day passes, and their ticket number, first name, email, age, gender, and pass type would be recorded into the customer table. As the day goes on, more people come into the park, and thus the wait time of the rides increase. At about midday, the friends get hungry so they go to their favorite concession stands to get food. Here, the sales would be recorded in the sales table. The customer, concession, food, and employee would all be recorded with an associated sales number. When the group of friends get tired, they decide to head out. But they had such a fun time that they decide to upgrade their tickets to a month pass. So, the customer table is updated so that each of the friends now have “month” in the pass type attribute."

This can help us plan if we ever want to invest in new rides we know what types to incorporate in the park. Also, knowing what rides are the most popular, we can figure out where there is more customer “traffic” and we can add more vendors selling food/drinks and toys to maximize profit.The users in the scenario can use this information as well to see which rides are the hottest attractions. We understand that people travel far distances to have the ultimate Planet Fun Experience and going on the 3 most popular rides is definitely part of the experience!\n"
